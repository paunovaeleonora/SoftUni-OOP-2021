"""some -- more than less, but less than more.

some is a pagerâ€¦ sometimes. If the input is less than one screen long,
some will print it directly to the terminal; otherwise, it will display
it using whatever pager is configured.

It should be noted that some doesn't actually know how your terminal
will render text, and so its behaviour is inherently based on an
approximation of how a small subset of text is usually rendered. In
situations where double-width characters or fancy ligatures are used,
for example, some will treat them as single-width when deciding whether
to invoke a pager.
